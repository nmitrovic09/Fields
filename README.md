# FIELDS

[Contribution guidelines for this project](imgs/fields-4262.jpg)

Fields is an interactive creation of magnetic fields that lets the user experience this unseen world we live in. The user selects one of the magnetic field motions and has the ability to create his own magnetic visualization which are unseen with the naked eye. He has control over the particles moving in the canvas with attractive, repulsive and spinning movements. This project enlightens the capacities of our visual perception. As the user creates his own fields, he is able to understand how the physical world is created. Every interaction is made with a detailed examination of the movement that the user could create with integrated mathematical formulas.

**FIELDS** challenges the user to draw his own patterns in which he creates new imperceivable magnetic fields.
