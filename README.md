# FIELDS

Fields is an interactive creation of magnetic fields that let the user experience this unseen world we live in. The user selects one of the magnetic field motions and has the ability to create his own magnetic visualizations. He has control over the particles moving in the canvas with attractive, repulsive and spinning motions. Magnetic fields are something we can not see with the naked eye. This project enlightens the capacities of our visual perception.

As the user creates his own fields, he is able to understand how the physical world is created. Every interaction is made with a detailed examination on the movement that the user could create with integrated mathematical formulas. **FIELDS** challenges the user to draw his own patterns in which he creates new imperceivable magnetic fields.
